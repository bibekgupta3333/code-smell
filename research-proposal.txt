Milestone 1: Project Proposal & Problem Formulation
Due Date: Thursday February 12, 2026, 11:59pm.
Submission Requirements (3–4 pages max)
Each team must submit a Professional Project Proposal Document containing:
1. Team Information
Our project corresponds to Project #1: Empirical Evaluation of LLM-Based Code Analysis Using the Smelly Code Dataset, selected from the project list. The current title of our study is "A Quantitative Assessment of Large Language Models for Code Smell Detection and Classification" and our group consists of Matthew Gregorat, Bibek Gupa, and Erick Orozco, all studying Computer Science. Our team will collaboratively design the evaluation framework, conduct empirical analysis, and interpret the results related to LLM performances on manually validated code smell data.



2. Problem Statement
Clearly articulate:
• What problem you are addressing
• Why it matters (technical, educational, or practical impact)
• Who benefits (developers, researchers, students, security analysts, etc.)
Please focus on a concrete gap or limitation.
3. Research Question(s) or Goals
Write primary RQs or goals, examples:
• How accurately can LLMs detect X compared to baseline tools?
• How effectively do LLMs distinguish malware from benign applications?
• Which method achieves the highest performance in …?
• Can our approach effectively classify…?
4. Scope & Assumptions
• What is in scope
• What is explicitly out of scope
• Constraints (datasets, platforms,…etc.)
5. Initial Methodology (High Level)
• Dataset(s) to be used
• Tools or techniques planned
• Type of analysis/work (empirical, comparative, qualitative, quantitative)
6. Expected Outcomes
• Tool artifact, dataset, empirical findings, or educational prototype
• Anticipated risks or challenges
